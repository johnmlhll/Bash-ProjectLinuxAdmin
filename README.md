# Bash-ProjectLinuxAdmin
This repo is a college project completed in my operating systems and networks module of my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing(Software Development). It was a fun project in bash where input files needed to be automatically validated with basic data transformation for output into a Linux file structure by Student ID.
