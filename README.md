# Bash-ProjectLinuxAdmin
This repo is a college project completed in my operating systems and networks module of my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing(Software Development). It was a fun project in bash where input files needed to be automatically validated with basic data transformation for output into a Linux file structure by Student ID. 

Technology used was Linux GUI (Via V/M on Oracle Virtual Box) O/S on my Mac (O/S Sierra) and bash scripting to develop the .sh file. I also used the Gedit editor as the console display is a little limiting and harder to read over larger scripts.

The .sh script is the output which has progress updates on its progression to console when run instead of documentation. If you would like formal documentation on this project (available for my other projects in dedicated repos), please let me know by reaching out at johnmhll@yahoo.com. Also, please note that if you are in the software industry and follow me on Twitter @johnmlhll, I will follow you back when I see your follow.
